Enterprise Mobile Device Management System
SIH 2024 - Problem Statement #25070
Cross-Platform Data Sanitization with Enterprise Security
Project Overview
A comprehensive enterprise-grade mobile device management system that combines device monitoring, data sanitization, compliance checking, and audit trail capabilities. Built specifically to address the need for secure, auditable, and compliant mobile device management in enterprise environments.
Key Features
Device Management

Real-time Android device detection and profiling
Comprehensive NIST 800-88 compliant device information collection
Hardware security assessment (TEE, encryption status, secure boot)
Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, Android)

Data Sanitization Engine

Multiple sanitization standards: Basic, DoD 5220.22-M, NIST 800-88, Gutmann
User-accessible data cleaning with progress monitoring
Sanitization verification and certification
Professional compliance documentation

Legal and Compliance
Intended Use
This software is designed for legitimate enterprise device management with proper authorization. Users must ensure legal ownership or explicit authorization for target devices, compliance with applicable data protection regulations, proper documentation and audit procedures, and appropriate use within organizational security policies.
Regulatory Compliance
Supports GDPR Article 17 (Right to Erasure), ISO 27001 Information Security Management, NIST 800-88 Guidelines for Media Sanitization, HIPAA data protection requirements, and SOX compliance documentation.
Performance Metrics
System Performance
Device detection completes within 10 seconds, compliance checking within 30 seconds, data assessment takes 1-5 minutes depending on data volume, sanitization time varies based on standard and data size, and report generation completes within 60 seconds.
Scalability
Supports concurrent handling of up to 5 devices, database capacity exceeds 100,000 audit records, report storage is limited by available disk space, and network deployment is suitable for small to medium enterprises.
Support and Maintenance
Log File Management
Application logs are stored in the logs directory, audit database maintains comprehensive records, and error logs can be accessed through system journal.
Backup Recommendations
Regular backup of configuration and logs is recommended, along with periodic audit database backup for compliance retention.
Update Procedures
Updates require backing up current installation, downloading updated application files, replacing main application file, reviewing configuration for new options, and testing functionality with non-critical devices.

Enterprise Compliance

Real-time GDPR and ISO27001 compliance monitoring
Automated policy compliance checking
Comprehensive audit trail system
Regulatory reporting capabilities

Professional Features

SQLite-based audit database
Multi-format report generation (PDF, CSV, JSON)
Policy management and deployment tracking
Certificate generation for compliance audits

System Requirements

Device Management Workflow

Device Connection: Connect Android device via USB
Authorization: Verify device ownership and authentication
Device Profiling: Automatic detection and comprehensive information gathering
Compliance Assessment: Run GDPR/ISO27001 compliance checks
Policy Application: Deploy enterprise policies as configured

Data Sanitization Process

Pre-Assessment: Scan user-accessible data directories
Authorization Verification: Confirm user permissions and device ownership
Standard Selection: Choose appropriate sanitization method
Execution: Perform data sanitization with real-time progress
Verification: Confirm sanitization completion
Documentation: Generate compliance certificates and audit records

Report Generation
Navigate to Reports tab, select report type, configure date range and options, then generate and export in preferred format.
Data Sanitization Standards
Available Standards

BASIC: Single-pass zero overwrite for basic data removal
DOD 5220.22-M: Three-pass military standard with random patterns
NIST 800-88: Cryptographic erase optimization for modern storage
GUTMANN: 35-pass comprehensive overwrite for maximum security

Sanitization Scope
The system targets user-accessible data directories including Downloads, Pictures, DCIM, Documents, Music, Movies, and app-specific user data.
Post-Sanitization Device Reset
Important Security Notice
After data sanitization, a factory reset is recommended for complete device restoration. This process must be performed manually by the device owner to ensure proper authorization.
Manual Factory Reset Methods
Method 1: Settings Menu (Recommended)
Navigate to Settings → System → Reset, select Erase all data (factory reset), review warning messages carefully, and confirm the reset operation. Enter device credentials if prompted and allow the device to restart.
Method 2: Hardware Reset (Recovery Mode)
Power off device completely, hold Volume Down and Power buttons simultaneously, navigate to Recovery Mode using volume keys, select Wipe data/factory reset, and confirm the operation.
Method 3: Remote Reset (Find My Device)
Visit android.com/find, sign in with device Google account, select target device, click Erase Device, and follow on-screen confirmation steps.
Post-Reset Verification
Verify that device boots to initial setup screen, all user data is removed, encryption keys are regenerated, Google account association is cleared, and device is ready for new deployment.
Compliance and Security
NIST 800-88 Implementation
Provides complete device technical profiling, storage technology identification, encryption status detection, TEE assessment, and hardware security module identification.
Audit Trail Requirements
Maintains timestamped operation logging, user authentication tracking, device identification and profiling, sanitization verification results, and compliance status monitoring.
Enterprise Security Features
Implements device ownership verification, multi-level authorization controls, encrypted audit log storage, professional certificate generation, and regulatory compliance documentation.
